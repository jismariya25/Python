# Health Metrics Analysis

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing health metrics to predict the presence of diabetes using the Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `Diabetes.csv`, which contains various health indicators and outcomes related to diabetes.

## Steps Involved
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the dataset and perform necessary cleaning operations.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data distributions and relationships.
3. **Machine Learning**: Train a model to predict diabetes outcomes based on health indicators.

## Usage
To run the project, execute the following command in your terminal:
```
python main.py
```
